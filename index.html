            <p id="testP class="funParagraph">It all started when my darling three year old asked about the beach as we watched videos on YouTube. She inquired about the sun, water, and the animals beneath the water. Oh but she wasn't ready for such a long long drive!</p>

            <h2><em>Chapter 2: Sand and Sunshine</em></h2>
               <p>We arrived late but that didn't stop us from visiting the beach. We walked along the water, collected a few seashells, and burried Daddy in the sand.</p>
